  <strong>How to contribute to ks-eye</strong>
</p>

---

## 🧭 Philosophy

> ks-eye is built on one principle: **AI suggests, human decides.**

Every feature you contribute to should align with this core philosophy:
- ✋ **Human-in-the-loop** — No fully automated decisions without human approval
- 📴 **Offline-first** — Core functionality must work without AI
- 🪜 **Step-by-step** — Guided workflows, not black boxes

## 📐 Coding Standards

### Python Style

```python
# ✅ DO: Type hints, double quotes, max 100 chars
def calculate_quality_score(
    data: list[dict],
    columns: list[str],
) -> dict:
    """Calculate data quality score from 0-100."""
    score = 100
    # ... implementation
    return {"score": score, "rating": "Good"}

# ❌ DON'T: No type hints, single quotes, long lines
def calc(data,cols):
    s=100
    # ... implementation that goes way beyond 100 characters and is hard to read
```

### Conventions

| Rule | Example |
|------|---------|
| **Double quotes** | `"hello"`, not `'hello'` |
| **Type hints** | `def foo(x: int) -> str:` |
| **Docstrings** | `"""One-line description."""` |
| **Max line length** | 100 characters |
| **Naming** | `snake_case` for functions, `PascalCase` for classes |
| **Constants** | `MAX_SOURCES = 20` |
| **Imports** | stdlib → third-party → local (alphabetical within groups) |

### User-Facing Messages

```python
# ✅ Use Rich console for all user messages
from ks_eye.ui import show_success, show_error, show_warning, show_info, console
from rich.panel import Panel

show_success("Data validated successfully")
console.print(Panel("Content here", title="Title", border_style="cyan"))

# ❌ Don't use print()
print("Data validated successfully")
```

### Error Handling

```python
# ✅ Graceful degradation when AI unavailable
if not check_tgpt_installed():
    show_warning("AI unavailable — entering manual mode")
    return _handle_manual_entry()

# ❌ Don't crash
result = run_ai_query()  # Raises if tgpt not installed
```

kseye analyze data.csv -c column_name  # Analysis (offline)
kseye quick "test query"               # Quick research (needs tgpt)

# Interactive mode
kseye                                  # Main menu should display
```
